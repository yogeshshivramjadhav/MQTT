# MQTT

# Go to wiki for step by step procedure 
### MQTT is a simple messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices with low-bandwidth.
### In MQTT there are a few basic concepts that you need to understand:

## Publish/Subscribe : 
### The first concept is the publish and subscribe system. In a publish and subscribe system, a device can publish a message on a topic, or it can be subscribed to a particular topic to receive messages

## Messages : 
### Messages are the information that you want to exchange between your devices. Whether itâ€™s a command or data.

## Topics : 
### Another important concept are the topics. Topics are the way you register interest for incoming messages or how you specify where you want to publish the message.

## Broker : 
### The broker is primarily responsible for receiving all messages, filtering the messages, decide who is interested in them and then publishing the message to all subscribed clients.
